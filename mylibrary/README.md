# MyLibrary

A new Flutter project that focuses on storing information about the books that the user has read.

# Motivation:
During my stay in a hostel, I fell in love with reading novels and I used to keep track of all the novels I have read in a book.
I wanted to have a digital copy that I can carry anywhere.

## Getting Started
Things that I wanted to implement
- [x] to access a book's API that gives information about the book. (Google Books API was selected for this purpose)
- [x] To find a backend that can store all the information. (Firestore was selected for this purpose)
- [x] The app should have a carousel that has all the books information

## Things I have learned From this project
- To Access and manage API
- To use Firebase authentication
- To read and store data in Firebase Firestore database
- Learned about Future and stream builder in <img alt="dart" width="30px" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81401804/149717313-a37e9052-6fb9-4c18-af3f-2067ddfff56f.png" />

## Things to work on
- Need to make the UI look neat
- To have a reward system that promotes one to read more
- to have a space where book lovers can talk about their love for their book
- To have a card that shows how many users have read that book
- To have a system that gives suggestions for books to read based on the users' history
